# Cyber

Miscellaneous notebooks for *.pcap parsing and analysis

DATASETS:
1. Download smallFlows.pcap and bigFlows.pcap files from https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/captures.html into your data directory

TELECOM MSc FINAL PROJECT:
SandBox.ipynb is the notebook containing some classifiers running on flows generated by Suricata
NB : a running Suricata installation is required : https://suricata.io/
Results were used for the Telecom MSc final project report

OTHER NOTEBOOKS:
1. Toy_pyshark.ipynb is a Jupyter NB with a minimal tutorial of the PyPacket class (in the cyberlib.py library).  Toy_pyshark is the *.py version, without the asyncio fix.
2. Toy_scapy.ipynb was an attempt to get my hands on Scapy. Proved to be too complicated for me.
3. Traitement_dataframes.ipynb is the notebook to run some unsupervised learning experiments out of Pandas dataframes. (It is required to run toy_pyshark.ipynb first to create a specific dataframe out of the *.pcap file)
4. network_graph is a utility notebook to draw the graph of IP conversations in a network.

NEXT (possibly):
1. Generic pipeline for EDA on any *.pcap file
2. DONE : Network trafic viz and EDA with NetworkX
3. Some anomaly detection code (inc. graph ?)
4. A PySpark-based code to handle live pcap stream
